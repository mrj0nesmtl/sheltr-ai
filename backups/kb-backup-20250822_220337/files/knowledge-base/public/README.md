## üéØ Mission & Vision

### Our Mission
**Hacking homelessness through technology.** We believe that by combining cutting-edge technology with compassionate action, we can create measurable, verifiable impact in the fight against homelessness.

### Our Vision
A world where every act of giving is transparent, every donation reaches its intended recipient, and every person experiencing homelessness has access to the tools and resources they need to rebuild their lives.

### Core Values
- **Empowerment**: Providing tools for individuals to take control of their futures
- **Transparency**: Every transaction visible and verifiable on the blockchain
- **Automation**: Streamlining processes for maximum efficiency and impact
- **Sustainability**: Building long-term solutions, not just short-term fixes
- **Innovation**: Leveraging the latest technology to solve age-old problems

- **Admin**: Shelter operators and staff
- **Participant**: Individuals receiving donations (the heart of our platform)
- **Donor**: Contributors making a difference

#### ü™ô SmartFund‚Ñ¢ Distribution
Every donation automatically distributes through blockchain smart contracts:
- **85%** ‚Üí Direct to participant's digital wallet
- **10%** ‚Üí Sustainable housing fund for long-term solutions
- **5%** ‚Üí Participant's registered shelter operations support

#### üì± QR-Powered Direct Giving
- Instant scan-and-give technology
- No intermediaries or delayed transfers
- Real-time confirmation and tracking
- Works offline for reliability

#### ‚õìÔ∏è Blockchain Transparency
