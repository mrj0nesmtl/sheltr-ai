SHELTR implements a revolutionary dual-token architecture that balances participant protection with community engagement. Our system combines **SHELTR-S** (stable utility token) with **SHELTR** (community governance token) to create a sustainable ecosystem that maximizes impact while protecting the vulnerable.

Built on Base network with Visa MCP integration, our tokenomics ensure 80% of all donations reach participants as stable value, 15% funds long-term housing solutions, and 5% supports platform operations - all verified on-chain for complete transparency.
