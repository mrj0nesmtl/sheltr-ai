# SESSION-09 TESTING CHECKLIST

## üß™ **Data Connectivity Testing Guide**

This checklist ensures all mock data has been replaced with real database connections and user-shelter associations are working properly.

---

## üîç **PRE-SESSION VALIDATION**

### **Current State Audit**
- [ ] Document all hardcoded numbers in dashboards
- [ ] Verify Firestore has 10 real shelters
- [ ] Confirm Firebase Auth users exist
- [ ] Test current registration flow (creates auth but no associations)

---

## üìä **PHASE 1: DATA SOURCE VERIFICATION**

### **Super Admin Dashboard Metrics**
**Location:** `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`

**BEFORE (Mock Data):**
- [ ] Shows `totalOrganizations: 47` (hardcoded)
- [ ] Shows `totalUsers: 1284` (hardcoded)  
- [ ] Shows `activeParticipants: 892` (hardcoded)
- [ ] Shows `totalDonations: 487200` (hardcoded)

**AFTER (Real Data):**
- [ ] Shows actual shelter count from Firestore
- [ ] Shows actual user count from Firebase Auth
- [ ] Shows actual participant count (role='participant')
- [ ] Shows actual donation sum (or 0 if no donations yet)
- [ ] Numbers match across all dashboards

### **Cross-Dashboard Consistency Check**
- [ ] Super Admin "Total Organizations" = Shelter Network "Total Shelters"
- [ ] Super Admin "Total Users" = User Management "Total Users"  
- [ ] Super Admin "Active Participants" = User Management "Participants Count"
- [ ] All role counts add up to total users

## üë• **PHASE 2: USER-SHELTER ASSOCIATION TESTING**

### **Test User 1: New Participant Registration**

**Setup:**
```bash
Email: test-participant-session9@example.com
Role: Participant
Name: Test Participant
```

**Testing Steps:**
1. **Registration Process**
   - [ ] Visit `/register`
   - [ ] Fill form with participant role
   - [ ] Submit successfully
   - [ ] Redirected to `/dashboard/participant`

2. **Database Verification**
   - [ ] User created in Firebase Auth ‚úÖ
   - [ ] User profile created in Firestore `users` collection ‚úÖ
   - [ ] User has `shelter_id` assigned (should be auto-assigned) ‚úÖ
   - [ ] User has `tenant_id` set to `shelter-{shelter_id}` ‚úÖ
   - [ ] User `status` is 'active' ‚úÖ

3. **Dashboard Impact**
   - [ ] Super Admin dashboard shows increased user count
   - [ ] Super Admin dashboard shows increased participant count
   - [ ] Assigned shelter shows new participant in their dashboard
   - [ ] Numbers are consistent across all dashboards

### **Test User 2: New Shelter Admin Registration**

**Setup:**
```bash
Email: test-admin-session9@example.com
Role: Shelter Admin
Name: Test Admin
```

**Testing Steps:**
1. **Registration Process**
   - [ ] Register with 'admin' role
   - [ ] Should prompt for shelter selection OR require approval
   - [ ] Status should be 'pending' if approval required

2. **Super Admin Assignment**
   - [ ] Super admin can assign admin to specific shelter
   - [ ] Admin's `shelter_id` gets updated
   - [ ] Admin's `status` changes to 'active'

3. **Admin Dashboard Access**
   - [ ] Admin can login and access `/dashboard/shelter-admin`
   - [ ] Admin only sees data for their assigned shelter
   - [ ] Participant count shows only participants from their shelter
   - [ ] Services are filtered by their `shelter_id`

### **Test User 3: New Donor Registration**

**Setup:**
```bash
Email: test-donor-session9@example.com
Role: Donor
Name: Test Donor
```

**Testing Steps:**
1. **Registration Process**
   - [ ] Register with 'donor' role
   - [ ] Should NOT be assigned to shelter (shelter_id = null)
   - [ ] Status should be 'active' immediately

2. **Donor Dashboard Access**
   - [ ] Can access `/dashboard/donor`
   - [ ] Sees platform-wide impact metrics
   - [ ] Can view all shelters for donation targeting

---

## üîó **PHASE 3: DATA RELATIONSHIP TESTING**

### **Shelter-Participant Relationships**
- [ ] Each participant belongs to exactly one shelter
- [ ] Shelter admins can only see their shelter's participants
- [ ] Super admins can see all participants across all shelters
- [ ] Participant count per shelter is accurate

### **Service-Shelter Associations**
- [ ] Services are filtered by shelter_id
- [ ] Participants only see services from their shelter
- [ ] Shelter admins only manage services for their shelter
- [ ] Service booking creates appointments with correct shelter_id

### **Multi-Tenant Data Isolation**
- [ ] Participants from Shelter A cannot see Shelter B's data
- [ ] Shelter A admin cannot see Shelter B's participants
- [ ] Services are properly isolated by shelter
- [ ] Appointments respect shelter boundaries

---

## üìà **PHASE 4: REAL-TIME DATA TESTING**

### **Dynamic Count Updates**
1. **User Registration Test**
   - [ ] Note current user count in Super Admin dashboard
   - [ ] Register new user
   - [ ] Refresh Super Admin dashboard
   - [ ] Verify count increased by 1
   - [ ] Check that participant/donor/admin counts updated correctly

2. **Service Booking Test**
   - [ ] Note current appointment count
   - [ ] Book a service as participant
   - [ ] Verify appointment created with correct shelter associations
   - [ ] Check that appointment appears in both participant and admin dashboards

3. **Real-Time Updates (Bonus)**
   - [ ] Dashboard updates without page refresh (if implemented)
   - [ ] Firestore listeners update counts automatically
   - [ ] Multiple users see consistent data simultaneously

---

## üß™ **PHASE 5: ERROR HANDLING & EDGE CASES**

### **Data Integrity Tests**
- [ ] User with invalid shelter_id shows appropriate error
- [ ] Missing shelter assignments are handled gracefully
- [ ] Database connection failures show meaningful messages
- [ ] Malformed data doesn't crash dashboards

### **Permission Testing**
- [ ] Participants cannot access admin dashboards
- [ ] Shelter admins cannot access super admin features
- [ ] Users cannot see data from other shelters
- [ ] Unauthenticated users are redirected to login

### **Fallback Scenarios**
- [ ] If real data fails to load, show loading state
- [ ] Clear error messages for data fetch failures
- [ ] Graceful degradation if Firestore is unavailable
- [ ] No crashing if expected data fields are missing

---

## ‚úÖ **PHASE 6: FINAL VALIDATION**

### **Production Readiness Checklist**
- [ ] All hardcoded mock data removed from codebase
- [ ] All dashboard numbers come from database queries
- [ ] User registration creates proper database relationships
- [ ] Role-based access control works correctly
- [ ] Cross-dashboard data consistency verified
- [ ] Performance acceptable with real data queries
- [ ] Error handling covers all failure scenarios

### **Business Logic Validation**
- [ ] New shelters can be added and users assigned
- [ ] Participants can be transferred between shelters
- [ ] Services respect shelter boundaries
- [ ] Donations can be tracked per shelter (when implemented)
- [ ] Reporting shows accurate, real-time data

### **User Experience Validation**

- [ ] Dashboards load quickly with real data
- [ ] Loading states provide good user feedback
- [ ] Error messages are helpful and actionable
- [ ] Data relationships are logical and clear to users

- Permissions that allow cross-shelter data access

### **Performance Issues**
- Slow dashboard loading with real data queries
- Excessive Firestore reads during navigation
- Unoptimized queries causing timeouts
- Memory leaks with real-time listeners

### **User Experience Issues**

## üìã **POST-SESSION VERIFICATION**

After Session 9 completion, verify:

1. **Platform Test:** Complete user journey from registration to dashboard usage

3. **Scale Test:** Performance remains good with realistic data volumes
4. **Security Test:** Users cannot access unauthorized data
5. **Business Test:** Platform ready for real users and meaningful interactions

**Final Goal:** SHELTR-AI transformed from a beautiful prototype to a real, data-connected platform ready for production users. üöÄ**
