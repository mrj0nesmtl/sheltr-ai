## 🪙 SHELTR Token & Blockchain Architecture

### Four-Role User System
| Role | Description | Tenant Location | QR Access |
|------|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| **SuperAdmin** | SHELTR Founders & Platform Operators | `tenants/platform/` | System-wide |
| **Admin** | Shelter Operators & Staff | `tenants/shelter-{id}/` | Shelter-specific |
| **Participant** | Donation Recipients (Homeless Individuals) | `tenants/shelter-{id}/participants/` OR `tenants/participant-network/` | Personal QR code |
| **Donor** | People Making Donations | `tenants/donor-network/` | Scan participant QRs |

### SHELTR Token System Design

#### Token Structure Options
```typescript
// Option 1: USDC Stablecoin Integration
interface SHELTRTokenUSDC {
  baseToken: 'USDC',
  network: 'Polygon' | 'Ethereum',
  purpose: 'Direct dollar-equivalent donations',
  benefits: 'Price stability, wide acceptance',
  smartContract: 'SHELTR Distribution Contract'
}

// Option 2: Custom SHELTR Token
interface SHELTRToken {
  symbol: 'SHLTR',
  type: 'ERC-20',
  totalSupply: '1,000,000,000',
  distribution: {
    participants: '60%',     // Direct to participants
    shelters: '25%',         // Shelter operations
    platform: '10%',        // SHELTR operations
    reserve: '5%'           // Emergency fund
  }
}

// Option 3: Hybrid Approach
interface HybridSystem {
  donationToken: 'USDC',              // Donations in stable value
  rewardToken: 'SHLTR',               // Gamification & rewards
  governanceToken: 'SHELTR-GOV',      // Platform governance
}
```

#### Smart Contract Architecture
```solidity
// Core SHELTR donation contract
contract SHELTRDonations {
    struct Participant {
        address wallet;
        string qrCodeHash;
        bool verified;
        uint256 totalReceived;
        address associatedShelter; // Optional: 0x0 for independent
    }
    
    struct Donation {
        address donor;
        address participant;
        uint256 amount;
        uint256 timestamp;
        string purpose; // "food", "shelter", "medical", etc.
    }
    
    // SmartFund™ Distribution (80/15/5)
    function distributeDonation(
        address participant,
        uint256 amount
    ) external {
        uint256 directToParticipant = (amount * 80) / 100;
        uint256 toHousingFund = (amount * 15) / 100;
        uint256 toOperations = (amount * 5) / 100;
        
        // Execute distribution...
    }
}
```
