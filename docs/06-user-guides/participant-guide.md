## 📱 Using Your QR Code

### How Your QR Code Works

Your QR code is your connection to donations. Here's how it works:

1. **Display your QR code** (on your phone, printed card, or wearable)
2. **Donor scans** your code with their phone
3. **Donation is processed** instantly through blockchain
4. **You receive 80%** directly in your wallet
5. **15% goes to housing fund** for long-term solutions
6. **5% supports platform** operations

### Best Practices for Your QR Code

#### ✅ Do:
- Keep your phone charged when possible
- Ask shelter staff for printed backup cards
- Explain to potential donors how easy it is
- Share your story when comfortable
- Keep your QR code visible but safe

#### ❌ Don't:
- Share your QR code image online
- Let others use your QR code
- Worry if someone scans it accidentally (they choose to donate)

### QR Code Display Options

| Method | Best For | Pros | Cons |
|--------|----------|------|------|
| **Phone Screen** | Most interactions | Always updated, interactive | Needs battery |
| **Printed Card** | Backup, always available | No battery needed | Can be lost/damaged |
| **Wearable Badge** | Hands-free visibility | Always visible | More permanent |
| **Shelter Display** | When at partner shelter | Professional, trustworthy | Only when at shelter |
