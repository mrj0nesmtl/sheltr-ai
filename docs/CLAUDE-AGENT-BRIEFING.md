## 🌟 **Project Overview: SHELTR-AI**

### **Mission Statement**
SHELTR-AI is a revolutionary platform that "hacks homelessness" through technology-driven charitable giving. We combine QR code instant donations, blockchain transparency, and AI-powered insights to create direct pathways from donors to individuals experiencing homelessness.

### **Core Innovation: SmartFund™ Distribution**
- **80%** → Direct support to participants
- **15%** → High-yield housing fund for permanent solutions  
- **5%** → Operational sustainability

Every donation is processed through smart contracts ensuring transparent, automated distribution.

## 📖 **Project Genesis & Gunnar's Legacy**

### **The Phoenix Moment**
This project represents a complete rebuild from a devastating database loss. The original SHELTR platform suffered an unrecoverable Supabase database failure, forcing a complete architectural rethink. What seemed like a catastrophe became an opportunity to build something far better.

### **In Loving Memory: Gunnar Blaze (2010-2025)**
This project is dedicated to Gunnar Blaze, the user's German Shepherd who passed away at age 15. Gunnar embodied the values that drive SHELTR-AI:
- **Loyalty**: Unwavering commitment to those we serve
- **Protection**: Creating safe spaces for vulnerable individuals  
- **Unconditional Care**: Love and support without judgment

Every feature we build honors Gunnar's memory by extending these values to people experiencing homelessness.

## 🏗️ **Technical Architecture Evolution**

### **Legacy Architecture** (Lost)
- **Database**: Supabase (unrecoverable loss)
- **Hosting**: Replit (limitations encountered)
- **Frontend**: React with scattered component structure
- **Status**: Abandoned due to technical debt and infrastructure failure

### **New SHELTR-AI Architecture** (Current)
- **Backend**: Python 3.11 + FastAPI (Google Cloud Run)
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore (multi-tenant, real-time)
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth with custom claims
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 + React 18 + TypeScript
- **Mobile**: Expo React Native
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum/Polygon smart contracts
- **Hosting**: Firebase Hosting + Google Cloud infrastructure
- **Repository**: `github.com/mrj0nesmtl/sheltr-ai`

---

## 👥 **4-Role System Architecture**

### **Role Hierarchy & Permissions**
1. **SuperAdmin**: System-wide control, analytics, user management
2. **Admin (Shelter Operators)**: Shelter management, participant oversight
3. **Participant (Donation Recipients)**: QR code management, donation tracking
4. **Donor**: Giving interface, impact tracking, history

### **Key Enhancement**
The original system had only 3 roles. We added the **Participant** role as an independent entity (not tied to specific shelters) to accommodate individuals who may not be affiliated with formal shelter systems.

---

## 🔗 **Blockchain & Token System**

### **Smart Contract Architecture**
```solidity
// Core distribution logic (80/15/5)
function processDonation(address participant, uint256 amount) external {
    uint256 toParticipant = (amount * 80) / 100;
    uint256 toHousing = (amount * 15) / 100;
    uint256 toOperations = (amount * 5) / 100;
    
    // Automated distribution via smart contracts
}
```

### **Token Options**
- **USDC**: Price-stable donations, immediate utility
- **Custom SHLTR**: Platform governance, community voting
- **Hybrid**: Best of both approaches
